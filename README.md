### Notes

#### 2/3/19

Yay! No semicolons!! :thumbsup: :thumbsup:

Writing comments helps me get acquainted and orient myself with an unknown project. Components are pretty self-explanatory, but I'll add some comments for the actions and reducers.

I'm a really big proponent of semantic markup, so I can swap out some `div`s and remove some that are unnecessary &mdash; give a little meaning to these elements, but keep it pretty basic. I'll probably make a few more changes when I get to building out the layout based on the design.
